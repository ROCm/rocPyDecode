rocPyDecode documentation
********************************************************************

The rocDecode Python Binding, rocPyDecode, is a tool that allows users to access rocDecode APIs in 
both Python and C/C++ languages. It works by connecting Python and C/C++ libraries, enabling function 
calling and data passing between the two languages. The rocpydecode.so library is a wrapper that facilitates 
the use of rocDecode APIs that are written primarily in C/C++ language within Python.
