> [!NOTE]
> The published documentation is available at [rocPyDecode](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocPyDecode/en/latest/index.html) in an organized, easy-to-read format, with search and a table of contents. The documentation source files reside in the `docs` folder of this repository. As with all ROCm projects, the documentation is open source. For more information on contributing to the documentation, see [Contribute to ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/contributing.html).

rocPyDecode is a Python binding library that connects Python with AMD’s [rocDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocDecode) and [rocJPEG](https://github.com/ROCm/rocJPEG) C/C++ APIs, enabling seamless function calls and data exchange between the two languages. It serves as a high-level wrapper, making the video and image decoding capabilities of rocDecode and rocJPEG accessible from Python.

rocPyDecode includes [rocPyJpegDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode/blob/develop/docs/reference/rocPyJPEGDecode-api.rst#rocpyjpegdecode-python-api) when the underlying rocJPEG library is available on the system, providing JPEG-specific decoding support through Python.
The library supports multi-VCN configurations via batch decoding, making it well-suited for high-throughput and parallelized image and video processing workloads.

  ```shell
  sudo apt install cmake
  ```

* [rocDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocDecode)

  ```shell
  sudo apt install rocdecode-dev
  ```

* [rocJPEG](https://github.com/ROCm/rocJPEG)

  ```shell
  sudo apt install rocjpeg-dev

  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Required compiler support
>   * C++17
>   * Threads

>[!NOTE]
> * All package installs are shown with the `apt` package manager. Use the appropriate package manager for your operating system.

### Prerequisites setup script

For your convenience, we provide the setup script, [rocPyDecode-requirements.py](rocPyDecode-requirements.py), which installs all required dependencies. Run this script only once on bare metal, if using docker please see below instructions.

```shell
python3 rocPyDecode-requirements.py
```

## rocPyDecode install

The installation process uses the following steps:

* [ROCm-supported hardware](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html) install verification

* Install ROCm `7.0.0` or later with [amdgpu-install](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/how-to/amdgpu-install.html) with `--usecase=rocm`

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Use **either** [package install](#package-install) **or** [source install](#source-install) as described below.

### Package install

Install rocPyDecode runtime, and test packages.

* Runtime package - `rocpydecode` only provides the python bindings for rocDecode
* Test package - `rocpydecode-test` provides ctest to verify installation

#### `Ubuntu`

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install rocpydecode rocpydecode-test
  ```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Python module: To use python module, set PYTHONPATH:
>   + `export PYTHONPATH=/opt/rocm/lib:$PYTHONPATH`

### Source install

To build rocPyDecode from source and install, follow the steps below:

* Clone rocPyDecode source code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode.git
```

* Build rocPyDecode with the **CMake**

  + run the requirements script to install all the dependencies required:

  ```shell
  cd rocPyDecode
  python3 rocPyDecode-requirements.py
  ```

  + run the below commands to build rocPyDecode:

  ```shell
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ../
  make -j8
  sudo make install
  ```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> * rocPyDecode will be installed for all Python versions on the system. To install rocPyDecode for a specific Python version, use the cmake `-D PYTHON_VERSION_SUGGESTED=version_num` directive, where version_num is the target Python version.

  + run tests - [test option instructions](https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/wiki/CTest)
  ```shell
  make test
  ```

>[!NOTE]
> To run tests with verbose option, use `make test ARGS="-VV"`.
> [Alternate source install methods](https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode/wiki/rocPyDecode-Alternate-Install-Methods)

## Run CTest

This will run python samples and show pass/fail.
>[!NOTE]
> install rocPydecode before running tests

### Dependencies:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple hip-python
```

### Run tests with source
```shell
mkdir rocpydecode-test && cd rocpydecode-test
cmake ../rocPyDecode/tests
ctest -VV
```

### Run tests with rocpydecode-test package

Test package will install ctest module to test rocPyDecode. Follow below steps to test package install

```shell
mkdir rocpydecode-test && cd rocpydecode-test
cmake /opt/rocm/share/rocpydecode/tests
ctest -VV
```
>[!NOTE]
> Make sure all required libraries are in your PATH
> ```shell
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rocm/lib
> export PYTHONPATH=/opt/rocm/lib:$PYTHONPATH
> ```
