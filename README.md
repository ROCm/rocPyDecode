# rocDecode Python Binding

> [!NOTE]
> The published documentation is available at [rocPyDecode](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocPyDecode/en/latest/index.html) in an organized, easy-to-read format, with search and a table of contents. The documentation source files reside in the `docs` folder of this repository. As with all ROCm projects, the documentation is open source. For more information on contributing to the documentation, see [Contribute to ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/contributing.html).


The rocDecode Python Binding, rocPyDecode, is a tool that allows users to access rocDecode APIs in both Python and C/C++ languages. It works by connecting Python and C/C++ libraries, enabling function calling and data passing between the two languages. The rocpydecode.so library is a wrapper that facilitates the use of rocDecode APIs that are written primarily in C/C++ language within Python.

## Prerequisites setup script

For your convenience, we provide the setup script, [rocPyDecode-requirements.py](rocPyDecode-requirements.py), which installs all required dependencies.\
Run this script only once on bare metal, if using docker please see below instructions.

```bash
python3 rocPyDecode-requirements.py
```

## rocPyDecode install

### using bare-metal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode.git
cd rocPyDecode
sudo pip3 install .
```
>[!NOTE]
> `sudo` access is needed

### creating python distribution wheel

```bash
# the generated .whl file will be located under subfolder ./dist/
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode.git
cd rocPyDecode
# Create/Build the wheel and install it
sudo python3 build_rocpydecode_wheel.py
# alternative method
sudo python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```
>[!NOTE]
> `sudo` access is needed

### using docker environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode.git
cd rocPyDecode
python rocPyDecode-docker-install.py 
```
>[!NOTE]
> Do NOT use `sudo`

## Run CTest
This will run python samples and show pass/fail.

### Dependencies:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple hip-python
```

### Run test:

```
cd rocPyDecode
cmake .
ctest -VV
```
